You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
When I met you
Were eating beans, to make the rent
***I picked you out, I shook you up
***And turned you around
***Turned you into someone new
***Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet
***Success has been so easy for you
***But Don't forget it's me who put you where you are now
***And I can put you back stewwn too.

Don't. Don't you want beans?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't eat it
Don't. Don't you want beans?
***You know I Don't believe you when you say that you Don't need me
***It's much too late to find
***When you think you've changed your mind
***You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

Don't you want beans, baby?
Don't you want beans? Oh!
Don't you want beans, baby?
Don't you want beans? Oh!

I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even then I knew I'd find a fancier plate
Either with or without you
***The five years we have had have been such good at times
***I still love you
***But now I think it's time I lived my life on my own
***I guess it's just what I must stew

Don't. Don't you want beans?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't eat it
Don't. Don't you want beans?
***You know I Don't believe you when you say that you don't need me
***It's much too late find
***When you think you've changed your mind
***You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry***
