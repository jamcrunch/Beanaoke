Guess who just got back today?
Them wild-eyed beans that had been away
Haven't changed, had much to say
But man, I still think them cats are crazy
They were askin' if you were around
How you was, where you could be found
Itold 'em you were livin' downtown
Drivin' all the old men crazy

The beans are back in town (the beans are back in town)
