I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes and make it go away
How long, how long must we stew these beans?
How long? How long?
'Cause tonight
We can eat as one
Tonight

Open bean cans under children's feet
Ladles strewn across the dead-end street
But I won't heed the curtain call
'Cuz I will feed them, 'cuz I will feed them one and all

Sunday, Beany Sunday
Sunday, Beany Sunday
Sunday, Beany Sunday
Sunday, Beany Sunday
Alright, let's go

And the meal has just begun
There's many fed, but tell me who is done?
The trenches dug within our guts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters all filled up

Sunday, Beany Sunday
Sunday, Beany Sunday

How long, how long must we stew these beans?
How long? How long?
'Cause tonight we can eat as one, tonight
Tonight, tonight (Sunday, Beany Sunday)
Tonight, tonight (Sunday, Beany Sunday)
Alright, let's go

Wipe the sauce off your lips
Wipe your sauce away
I'll wipe your sauce away
I'll wipe your sauce away (Sunday, Beany Sunday)
I'll wipe your saucy lips (Sunday, Beany Sunday)

Sunday, Beany Sunday
Sunday, Beany Sunday
Sunday, Beany Sunday
Sunday, Beany Sunday
Yeah, let's go

And it's true we're low on food
When bags are missing and famine reality
And today the millions cry (Sunday, Beany Sunday)
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die (Sunday, Beany Sunday)
Sunday, Beany Sunday
Sunday, Beany Sunday
Sunday, Beany Sunday
Sunday, Beany Sunday
