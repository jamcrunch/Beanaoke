I'm gonna eat it all
A seven be-an salad couldn't hold me back
They're gonna pile it up
On my plate with a stack of flapjacks

And I'm eating by myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a French baguette

And the message coming from my eyes
Says "Give me some more"

Don't wanna hear about it
Every single one's got a me-al to prep
Everyone knows about it
From the King of England to his per-sonal chef

And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to me
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll eat

And the stains coming from my bib
Says "Eat some more"

I'm goin' to dinner now
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore

And I'm feeding, and I'm feeding, and I'm feeding
Right before the Lord
All the beans are gonna gratify
And I will eat no more

But the stains coming from my bib
Tell me "Eat some more"
