I'm dried and dessicated
And I grew up from the ground
I could've been a beanstalk
But now I am stew bound

I lost all my podmates
In this savory world
Wish I was an entrée
A main fuckin' entrée

But I'm a bean
I'm a leguuuuuuuuume
Why am I in a kiddie pool?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna be in a bowl
Mixed with the perfect spices
Served with a kaiser roll

I want you to taste me
And catch my flavor notes
I wanna be an entrée
A main fuckin' entrée

But I'm a bean
I'm a leguuuuuuuuume
Why am I in a kiddie pool?
I don't belong here

Beeeeaaans spilling on the floor
Beeeans spilling
Beans-Beans-Beans-Beaaaansss

Beaaaaaanssssss

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
Just wanna be an entrée
Wish I was an entrée

But I'm a bean
I'm a leguuuuuuuuume
Why am I in a kiddie pool?
I don't belong here
I don't bean-long here
