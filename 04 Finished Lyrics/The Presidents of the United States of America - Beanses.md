Movin’ to the country
Gonna eat a lot of beanses

I’m movin’ to the country
Gonna eat a lot of beanses

Movin’ to the country
Gonna eat a lot of beanses

Movin’ to the country
Gonna eat a lot of beanses

Beanses come from a can
They were put there by a man
In a beanery downtown
If I had my little way
I’d eat beanses every day
And scoopin' bowls from the buffet

I’m movin’ to the country
Gonna eat a lot of beanses

Movin’ to the country
Gonna eat a lot of beanses

Movin’ to the country
Gonna eat a lot of beanses

Movin’ to the country
Gonna eat a lot of beanses

Took a little nap where the beans all sit
Squished a ladle of beans in my fist
And dreamed about you, bean pool
I poked my finger down inside
Make a little for room some beans to slide
Nature's candy in my hand or can or a pie
