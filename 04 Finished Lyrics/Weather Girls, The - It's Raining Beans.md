Hi (hi)
We're your Weather Girls (uh-huh)
And have we got news for you (you better listen)
Get ready, all you hungry girls
And leave those umbrellas at home (alright)
 
Humidity is rising (hm, rising)
Barometer's getting low (how low, girl?)
According to all sources (what sources now?)
Bean Camp's the place to go (we better hurry up)
 
'Cause tonight for the first time (first time)
Just about ten fifteen (ten fifteen)
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining beans (start raining beans)
 
It's raining beans, hallelujah
It's raining beans, amen
I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna let myself get
Pelted with beans on my head
 
It's raining beans, hallelujah
It's raining beans, every heirloom breed
Red, soy, white, and green
Adzuki and black-eyed peas
 
God bless Mother Nature
She's a hungry woman, too
She took off to heaven
And she did what she had to do
 
She taught every angel
And rearranged the sky
So that each and every woman
Could stock her bean supply
 
It's raining beans, hallelujah
It's raining beans, amen
It's raining beans, hallelujah
It's raining beans, amen
 
I feel stormy weather moving in
About to begin (about to begin)
Hear the thunder
Don't you lose your head
Rip off the roof and stay in bed (rip off the roof and stay in bed)
 
God bless Mother Nature
She's a hungry woman, too
She took off to heaven
And she did what she had to do
 
She taught every angel
She rearranged the sky
So that each and every woman
Could stock her bean supply
 
Ooh, it's raining beans, yeah
