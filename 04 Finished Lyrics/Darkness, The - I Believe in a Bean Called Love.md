Can't explain all the feelings
that you're making me feel
My gut's in overdrive
and you're behind the steering wheel

Cooking you, feeding me
Cooking you, God, you're feeding me

I believe in a bean called love
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it now
We'll be eating 'til the sun goes down
I believe in a bean called love, hoo-oo-oo-oo

I wanna eat you every minute, every hour, every day
You got me in a spin but everything is a okay
Cooking you, feeding me
Cooking you 'cause you're feeding me

I believe in a bean called love
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it now
We'll be eating 'til the sun goes down
I believe in a bean called love, hoo-oo-oo-oo

Beantar

Cooking you, feeding me
Cooking you, God, you're feeding me, oo
I believe in a bean called love
Just listen to the rhythm of my fart
There's a chance we could make it now
We'll be eating 'til the sun goes down
I believe in a bean called love
