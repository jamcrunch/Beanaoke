You don't have to sit by the heat lamp
Those days are over
You don't have to sell your
contents to the camp

Bean Can
You don't have to open up tonight
Work the aisles for money
You don't care if it's
wrong or if it's right

Bean Can
You don't have to sit by the heat lamp
Bean Can
You don't have to sit by the heat lamp

Under the heat lamp
Under the heat lamp
Under the heat lamp
Under the heat lamp
Under the heat lamp

I craved you since I knew you
I wouldn't talk down to you
I have to tell you just how I feel
I won't share you with another boy

I know my mind is made up
So put away your ketchup
Told you once, I won't tell you again
It's a bad way

Bean Can
You don't have to sit by the heat lamp
Bean Can
You don't have to sit by the heat lamp

You don't have to sit by the heat lamp
Under the heat lamp
Under the heat lamp
Under the heat lamp
Under the heat lamp
Under the heat lamp
Under the heat lamp
Under the heat lamp
Under the heat lamp
Under the heat lamp
You don't have to sit by the heat lamp
Under the heat lamp
You don't have to sit by the heat lamp
Under the heat lamp
Under the heat lamp
Under the heat lamp
Under the heat lamp
