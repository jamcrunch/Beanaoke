Punctured beancycle
In high desert desolate
Will nature make a bean of me yet?

When in this kiddie pool
This charming beeean
Why pamper life's complexibeans
When the pintos run smooth
'tween the toes of your feet?

I would serve beans tonight
But I haven't got a can to spare
This bean said "It's gruesome
That someone so beansome should care"

Ah, a jumped-up pantry bean
Who never knew his place
He said "Return the bean"
He knows so much about these beans
He knows so much about these beans

I would serve beans tonight
But I haven't got a can to spare
This bean said "It's gruesome
That someone so beansome should care"

Na, na-na, na-na, na-na, this charming bean
Oh, na-na, na-na, na-na, this charming bean

Ah, a jumped-up pantry bean
Who never knew his place
He said "Return the bean"
He knows so much about these beans
He knows so much about these beans
