You know that I want beans

And you know that I need beans

I want it bad, your bean romance

I want your beans and I want your spice blend

You and me could write a bean romance

I want your beans and all your curried spice blends

You and me could write a bean romance

Want you in my bean salad, baby, you're sick

Beans, beans, beans, I want your beans

You know that I want beans

And you know that I need beans

I want it bad, your bean romance

I want your beans and I want your spice blend
