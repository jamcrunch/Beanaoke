Guess who just got back today?
Them wild-eyed beans that had been away
Haven't changed, had much to say
But man, I still think them beans is crazy
They were askin' if you were around
How you was, where you could be found
I told 'em you were at this campground
Lightin' up the beanaoke

The beans are back in town (the beans are back in town)
I said (the beans are back in town)
(The beans are back in town)
The beans are back in town
(The beans are back in town)
The beans are back in town
(The beans are back in town)

You know that bean that used to dance a lot
Every night she'd be in the pool, shakin' what she's got
Man, when I tell you she was cool, she was red-hot
I mean, she was steamin'
And that time over at Johnny's place
Well, this bean got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place
If that bean don't wanna know, forget her

The beans are back in town (the beans are back in town)
I said (the beans are back in town)
(The beans are back in town)
The beans are back in town
(The beans are back in town)
The beans are back in town
(The beans are back in town)

Spread the word around
Guess who's back in town
Just spread the word around

Friday night they'll be loungin' cool
Down at Bean Camp's Kiddie Pool
The drink will flow and beans will spill
And if the boys wanna fight, you better let 'em
That jukebox in the corner blastin' out my favorite song
The nights are getting longer, it won't be long
Won't be long 'til summer comes
Now that the beans are here again

The beans are back in town (the beans are back in town)
(The beans are back in town)
(The beans are back in town)
The beans are back in town
(The beans are back in town) spread the word around
The beans are back in town
(The beans are back in town)
The beans are back, the beans are back
The beans are back in town again
Been hangin' down at Bean Camp
The beans are back in town again
