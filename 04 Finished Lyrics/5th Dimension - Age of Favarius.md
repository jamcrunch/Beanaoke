When the year is in the Seventh Month
And all the stalks are fully green
Then we will pick the garden
It's time to harvest beans

This is the dawning of the age of Favarius
Age of Favarius

Harmony and understanding
Cooperate on bean gathering
No more hunger or anemia
Haricots of old Bohemia
Mystic legume revelation
And the bean's true liberation
