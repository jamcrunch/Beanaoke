Another vine hangs lowly
Bean is slowly taken
And the harvest was the harshest
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me
It's not my bag of beans
In your can, in your can, they are cooking
With their peas, and their mungs
And their mungs, and favas
In your can, in your can, they are frying

In your can, in your can
Zom-bean, zom-bean, zom-bean - ean - ean
What's in your can, in your can?
Zom-bean, Zom-bean, Zom-bean - ean - ean - ean oh

Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo

Another bean stalk's breaking  
Heart is taking over  
When the harvest is the harshest  
We must be mistaken  

It's the same old theme, since Nineteen Six Bean
In your can, in your can they're still cooking  
With their peas, and their mungs
And their mungs, and favas 
In your can, in your can they are frying

What's in your can, in your can?
Zom-bean, Zom-bean, Zom-bean - ean - ean - ean oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, eh-eh-oh, ra-ra
