I believe in miracles, where are you from?
You sexy bean, sexy bean, you
I believe in miracles since you came along
You sexy bean

Where did you come from, baby?
How did you know I needed you?
How did you know I need you so badly?
How did you know I'd eat up so gladly?

Yesterday I was one of the hungry people
Now you're lying on my plate, all ready to eat

I believe in miracles, where are you from?
You sexy bean, sexy bean, you
I believe in miracles since you came along
You sexy bean

Where did you come from, angel?
How did you know I'd be the one?
Did you know you're everything I prayed for?
Did you know every night and day for?

Every day, you'd give me that folic acid
Now you're lying on my plate, all ready to eat

I believe in miracles, where are you from?
You sexy bean, sexy bean, you
I believe in miracles since you came along
You sexy bean, ah
Feed me, you sexy bean
Sate me, baby, you sexy bean

I love the way you feed me, darling, you sexy bean
Oh, it's ecstasy, you sexy bean
Yesterday, I was one of the hungry people
Now you're lying on plate, satiating me

I believe in miracles, where are you from?
You sexy bean, sexy bean, you
I believe in miracles since you came along
You sexy bean, ah, feed me
Sate me, darling
I love the way you nourish, baby
Ah-ah, it's ecstasy
Ah, it's ecstasy (sexy bean)
Sate me, baby (sexy bean, sexy bean)
I love the way you feed me, darling (sexy bean, sexy bean)
Ah, yeah (sexy bean, sexy bean)
Love the way you nourish (sexy bean, sexy bean)
Keep on feeding me, darling (sexy bean, sexy bean)
Keep Sustaining me, baby (sexy bean, sexy bean)
