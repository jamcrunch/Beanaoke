And if she should tell you: "Come closer"  
And if she tempts you with her beans

Tell her no, no, no, no, no-no-no-no  
No, no, no, no, no-no-no-no  
No, no, no, no, no  
Don't hurt me now for her beans belong to me

And if she should tell you: "Here's my beans"  
Whoa-oh-oh  
And if she tempts you with her beans

Tell her no, no, no, no, no-no-no-no  
No, no, no, no, no-no-no-no  
No, no, no, no, no  
Don't hurt me now for her beans belong to me

I know she's the kind of girl  
Who'd throw my beans away  
But I still love her so  
Don't hurt me now, don't hurt me now

And if she should tell you: "Here's my beans"  
Just remember she gave them to me

Tell her no, no, no, no, no-no-no-no  
No, no, no, no, no-no-no-no  
No, no, no, no, no  
Don't leave her now for her beans belong to me
