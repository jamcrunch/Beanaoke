Just a small town bean
Livin' in a small canteen
She took a paper plate going anywhere

Just a city bean
Boston baked and full of dreams
He took a paper plate going anywhere

A sausage in a smokey stew
A smell of pork and gravy roux
In a pot they can share the night
They stew on and on and on and on

Ingredients waitin'
Up and down the bean-evard
Their flavors searchin' in the pot
Beanlights, people
Simm'rin' just to find emotion
Hidin', somewhere in the crock

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a meal
Payin' anything to get a slice
Just one more time

Some'll bake, some will stew
Some are served at barbeques
Whoa, the dinner never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Ingredients waitin'
Up and down the bean-evard
Their flavors searchin' in the pot
Beanlights, people
Simm'rin' just to find emotion
Hidin', somewhere in the crock

DON'T STOP BEAN-LIEVING
Hold on to that bean-ing
Beanlights, people
