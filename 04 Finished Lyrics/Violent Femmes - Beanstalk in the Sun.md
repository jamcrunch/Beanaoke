When I'm out gard'ning
I plant my stuff
Put my trellis out

Vines high as a kite
I just might
Stop to watch you sprout

Let me grow on
Like a beanstalk in the sun
Let me grow on
Bean hands, I know you're the one

Favas and beets
Growin' my eats
I don't even know why

My girlfriend
She is a chef
She is starting to fry

Let me grow on
Like a beanstalk in the sun
Let me grow on
Bean hands, I know you're the one

When I'm out gard'ning
I plant my stuff
Put my trellis out

Vines high as a kite
I just might
Stop to watch you sprout

When I'm out gard'ning
I plant my stuff
Put my trellis out

Vines high as a kite
I just might
Stop to watch you sprout

Favas and beets
Growin' my eats
I don't even know why

My girlfriend
She is a chef
She is starting to fry

When I'm out gard'ning
I plant my stuff
Put my trellis out

Vines high as a kite
I just might
Stop to watch you sprout

Let me grow on
Like a beanstalk in the sun
Let me grow on
Bean hands, I know you're the one
