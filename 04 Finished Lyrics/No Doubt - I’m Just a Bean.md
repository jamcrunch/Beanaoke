Husk this pod 'round my body bye
I'm exposed
And it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand?
This world is serving me with rice and ham

'Cause I'm just a bean
A little old me
Well, please let me soak overnight
Oh, I'm just a bean
Full of starch and protein
So why not just take a little bite?

Ohhhhh, I've had it up to here

The moment that I step outside
So many reasons
for you to come and dine
I can't grow into a vine
Because you're here
I'm on your dinner plate
It is so drear

'Cause I'm just a bean
I'd rather not be
'Cause I'm in a kiddie pool tonight
Oh, I'm just a bean, so come swim with me
Pour some beans on your head, close your eyes

Oh, I'm just a bean, take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype
Ohhhhh, I've had it up to here
Ohhhhh, am I making myself clear?
I'm just a bean
I'm just a bean in the world
That's all that you'll let me be
Oh, I'm just a bean, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb makes me worrisome
Oh, I'm just a bean, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to is making me numb
Oh, I'm just a bean, my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome
Oh, I'm just a bean, lucky me
Twiddle-dum, there's no comparison
Ohhhhh, I've had it up to
Ohhhhh, I've had it up to
Ohhhhh, I've had it up to here
