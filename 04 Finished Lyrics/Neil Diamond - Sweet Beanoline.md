Where it began  
I can't begin to know when  
But then I know it's growin' strong  
Was in the spring  
And spring became the summer  
Who'd have believe you'd come along?

Vines  
Touchin' Vines  
Reachin' out  
Touching me, touchin' you

Sweet Bean o' Mine  
Good times never seemed so good  
I've been inclined  
To believe they never would

But now I look at the night  
And it don't seem so lonely  
We fill it up with only two  
And when pang  
Hunger runs off my belly  
How can I pang when eatin' you?

Vines  
Touchin' vines  
Reachin' out  
Touchin' me, touchin' you

Sweet Bean o' Mine
Good times never seemed so good  
I've been inclined  
To believe they never would, oh, no, no

Sweet Bean o' Mine
Good times never seemed so good  
Sweet Bean of Mine  
I believe they never could  
Sweet Bean o' Mine
