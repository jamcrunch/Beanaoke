We're talking away  
I don't know what I'm to bake  
I'll bake it anyway  
Today is another day to feed you  
Fryin' away  
Oh, I'll be comin' for your beans, okay

Take on beans  
Take beans on  
I'll be gone  
In a day or two

So needless to say  
I'm odds and ends  
But I'll be cookin' away  
Slowly learnin' that dinner's okay  
Say after me  
It's much better to be sated than hungry

Take on beans  
Take beans on  
I'll be gone  
In a day or two

All the things that you bake, yeah  
Is it life or just to play my hungers away?  
You're all the things I've got to remember  
You're frying' away  
I'll be comin' for your beans okay

Take on beans  
Take beans on  
I'll be gone  
In a day  
I'll be gone  
In a day
