Lead

I'm just a poor boy
I need no sympathy  
  
Any way the bean grows
Doesn't really matter to me
To me  

Mama, just killed a man  
Chopped a beanstalk with my axe
Fell from the sky, he went splat
Mama, life had just begun  
But now I've gone and thrown it all away  
Mama, ooooooooo
Didn't mean to make you cry  
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow  
Carry on, carry on 
As if nothing really matters  

Too late
My time has come  
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time  
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
I took all his golden eggs and magic goose
Mama, ooooooooo 
I don't wanna die  
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all  

I see a little silhouetto of a man  
  
Thunderbolts and lightning
Very, very frightening me  
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo Figaro, magnifico  
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me  

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?  
Let him go 
Let him go
Let me go  
Let me go 
Never, never, never, never let me go  

Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia  
Mamma mia, let me go  
Bean-elzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me

So you think you can bean me and spit in my eye?  
So you think you can bean me and leave me to die?  
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby  
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here  

Ooh  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  

Nothing really matters, anyone can see  
Nothing really matters  
Nothing really matters to me  

Any way the bean grows


Backup
Is this the real life?
Is this just bean-tasy?  
Traded my cow for
a handful of magic beans 
When I awoke
looked up to the skies to see

Because I'm easy come, easy go,
little high, little low
Any way the bean grows
Doesn't really matter to me

Anyway the bean grows

Scaramouche, Scaramouche
Will you do the Fandango?

Thunderbolts and lightning
Very, very frightening me  

Galileo
Galileo
Galileo Figaro, magnifico

He's just a poor boy from a poor family  
Spare him his life from this monstrosity  

Bismillah!  
No, we will not let you go 

Bismillah!  
We will not let you go 

Bismillah!  
We will not let you go 
Will not let you go

No, no, no, no, no, no, no  

Bean-elzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me
