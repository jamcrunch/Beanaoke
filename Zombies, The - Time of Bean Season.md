It's the time of the season
To plant some beans
In this time, give it to me easy  
And let me try with pleasured hands

To take you in the sun  
To promised lands  
To show you every one  
It's the time of the season for loving

What's your name? (What's your name?)  
Who's your daddy? (Who's your daddy?)  
(He rich) is he rich like me?  
Has he taken (has he taken)  
Any time (any time)  
(To show) to show you what you need to live?

Tell it to me slowly  
Tell you what  
I really want to know  
It's the time of the season for loving

What's your name? (What's your name?)
