One way, or another, I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna eat ya, eat ya, eat ya, eat ya
One way, or another, I'm gonna soak ya
I'm gonna eat ya, eat ya, eat ya, eat ya
One way, or another, I'm gonna stew ya
I'm gonna eat ya, eat ya, eat ya, eat ya
One day, maybe next week
I'm gonna eat ya, I'm gonna eat ya, I'll eat ya

I will drive past your farm
And if the stalks are cut down
I'll see what's around

One way, or another, I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna eat ya, eat ya, eat ya, eat ya
One way, or another, I'm gonna bake ya
I'll eat ya, I'll eat ya
One way, or another, I'm gonna fry ya
I'm gonna eat ya, eat ya, eat ya, eat ya
One day, maybe next week, I'm gonna eat ya
I'll eat ya

And if the stalks are cut down
I'll follow your truck to town
See who's hanging out

One way, or another, I'm gonna shuck ya
I'm gonna give you the split
A quick little pick or another, I'm gonna shuck ya
I'll pick ya, I'll pick ya
One way, or another, I'm gonna shuck ya
I'm gonna pick ya, pick ya, pick ya, pick ya
One way, or another, I'm gonna shuck ya
I'm gonna give you the split

***I'll walk down the mall
stand over by the wall
***Where I can see it all
find out who you call
Lead you to
the supermarket checkout
Some specials and dried food
get lost in the crowd

One way, or another, I'm gonna eat ya
I'll eat ya, I'll eat ya, eat ya, eat ya, eat ya
One way, or another, I'm gonna eat ya
I'll eat ya, I'll eat ya, eat ya, eat ya, eat ya
One way, or another, I'm gonna eat ya
I'll eat ya, I'll eat ya, eat ya, eat ya, eat ya
One way, or another, I'm gonna eat ya
I'll eat ya, I'll eat ya, eat ya, eat ya, eat ya
One way, or another, I'm gonna eat ya
I'll eat ya, I'll eat ya, eat ya, eat ya, eat ya
One way, or another, I'm gonna eat ya
I'll eat ya, I'll eat ya, eat ya, eat ya, eat ya
One way, or another
