Mariah Carey - (Bean) Fantasy

Oh, when I walk by every night
Past your farm and see your vines
I get kinda hectic inside
Mmm, baby I'm so into stew
Darling, if you only knew
All the beans that flow through my mind

But it's just a bean, bean fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you sate me
I'm so deep in buffet dreams
But it's just a bean, bean fantasy baby

Images of pastures
Creep into me slowly
Scoops of beans on top of bread
And my mouth salivates
When you stew up lentils
Time and time and time again

But it's just a bean, bean fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you sate me
I'm so deep in buffet dreams
But it's just a bean, bean fantasy baby

Bean, bean fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you sate me
I'm so deep in buffet dreams
But it's just a bean, bean fantasy baby

In hog heaven
With my bean chef
My lovely bean chef
Eat multicourse meals
And there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming
But I'm eating beans

Bean, bean fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you sate me
I'm so deep in buffet dreams
But it's just a bean, bean fantasy baby

Bean, bean fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you sate me
I'm so deep in buffet dreams
But it's just a bean, bean fantasy baby
Bean, bean fantasy baby
Bean, bean fantasy baby
