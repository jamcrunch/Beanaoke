Cyndi Lauper - Girls Just Wanna Have Beans

•••I come home in the morning light
•••My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right?"
•••Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones
And girls, they wanna have beans
Oh girls just want to have beans

•••The phone rings in the middle of the night
•••My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
•••Oh daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have beans
Oh girls just want to have

That's all they really want
Some beans
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have beans
Oh girls just wanna have beans (girls, they wanna, wanna have beans, girls wanna have)

•••Some boys take a beautiful girl
•••And hide her away from the rest of the world
•••I want to be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls, they wanna have beans
Oh girls just wanna have

That's all they really want
Some beans
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have beans
Oh girls just want to have beans (girls, they wanna, wanna have beans, girls wanna have)
They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna, oh girl (girls just wanna have beans)
Girls just wanna have beans
They just wanna, they just wanna
They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna, oh girl (girls just wanna have beans)
Girls just want to have beans

Girls, they wanna have beans, everybody

They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna, oh girls (girls just wanna have beans)
