Loggins, Kenny - Flavor Zone

Revvin' up your range
Lookin' at her flames aroar
Metal under tension
Beggin' you to touch and go

Highway to the flavor zone
Ride into the flavor zone

Mixin' up the spices
Throwin' in cayenne tonight
It adds that extra little kick
That sends beans into overdrive

Highway to the flavor zone
I'll take you right into the flavor zone

You'll never maximize a stew
Until you get it on the red line overload
You'll never know what you can do
Until you crank your stove as high as it can go



Out along the edges
Always where I burn to be
The spicier it gets
The more deliciouser the bean

Highway to the flavor zone
Gonna take it right into the flavor zone
Highway to the flavor zone
Ride into the flavor zone
Highway to the flavor zone
Gonna take it right into the flavor zone
Highway to the flavor zone
Ride into the flavor zone
Highway to the flavor zone
Gonna take it right into the flavor zone
Highway to the flavor zone
Ride into the flavor zone
Highway to the flavor zone
