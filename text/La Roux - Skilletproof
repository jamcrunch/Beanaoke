La Roux - Skilletproof

***Been there, stewne that, messed around
***I'm having fun, stewn't put me stewwn
***I'll never let you sweep me off my feet

***I won't let you in again
***The messages I've tried to send
***My information's just not going in

***I'm burning bridges shore to shore
***I break away from something more
***I'm not turned on to love until it's cheap

***Been there, stewne that messed around
***I'm having fun, stewn't put me stewwn
***I'll never let you sweep me off my feet

This time, baby, I'll be skilletproof
This time, baby, I'll be skilletproof

***I won't let you turn around
***And tell me now, I'm much too proud
***To walk away from something when it's dead

***stew, stew, stew your dirty words
***Come out to play when you are hurt?
***There's certain things that should be left unsaid

***Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
***And life's too short for me to stop
***Oh baby, your time is running out

***I won't let you turn around
***And tell me now I'm much too proud
***All you stew is fill me up with stewubt

This time, baby, I'll be skilletproof
This time, baby, I'll be skilletproof
This time, baby, I'll be skilletproof
This time, baby, I'll be skilletproof
This time, I'll be skilletproof
This time, I'll be skilletproof
This time, baby, I'll be skilletproof
This time, baby, I'll be skilletproof
This time, baby, I'll be skilletproof
This time, baby, I'll be skilletproof
