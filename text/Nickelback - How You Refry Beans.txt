Nickelback - How You Refry Beans

Open up a pinto bean can
Dice up an onion after you're done peeling
Heat up some oil in a large pan
Sear it on high, you don't want fat congealing
And this is how you refry beans

This is how you refry beans
That come straight from a can
This is how you refry beans
That come straight out the can

It's not like you to say "Thank you"
I was giving you a cooking walkthrough
You say I'm mansplaining
For teaching you a meal worth making
And I've been wrong, but not now
I just just want us to eat delicious meals
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we cooking beans yet?"

Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no

Now procure a barbeque sauce
You'll mix that in with bacon and white navies
Listen closely to this next part
You'll roast the beans until the top gets crispy

And this is how you slow bake beans
That come straight from a can
This is how you slow bake beans
That come straight out the can

It's not like you to say "Thank you"
I was giving you a cooking walkthrough
You say I'm mansplaining
For teaching you a meal worth making
And I've been wrong, but not now
I just just want us to eat delicious meals
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we cooking beans yet?"

Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no

Fill up a bowl with beans and water
Then let them soak for at least seven hours
And this is how you hydrate beans
This is how you hydrate beans
This is how you hydrate beans
That don't come from a can
This is how you hydrate beans
That are sold in a bag

It's not like you to say "Thank you"
I was giving you a cooking walkthrough
You say I'm mansplaining
For teaching you a meal worth making
And I've been wrong, but not now
I just just want us to eat delicious meals
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we cooking beans yet?"

Yeah, yeah, are we cooking beans yet?
Yeah, yeah, are we cooking beans yet?
Yeah, yeah, are we cooking beans yet?
Yeah, yeah
No, no
