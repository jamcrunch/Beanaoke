Well, I just cooked a meal today
It seems my diii-et is going to change
I close my eyes, begin to taste
Then tears of joy stream down my face

With cans wide open, under the hood light
Welcome to this place, I'll show you every bean
With cans wide open

With cans wide open

Well, I don't know if I'm ready
To be the chef I have to be
I'll take this pot, I'll put my beans inside
And when they're stewed, then they'll be refried

With cans wide open under the hood light
Welcome to this place, I'll show you every bean
With cans wide open, my every meal has changed
I'll show you mungs, I'll show you every bean

With cans wide open
With cans wide open
I'll serve you every bean, oh yeah
With cans wide open
Wide open

If I cook just one dish, follow one meal plan
I'll stuff it full of beans, I hope you understand
That I can take this knife and hold it by the hand
And I can serve dinner with cans wide open

With cans wide open under the hood light  
Welcome to this place, I'll show you every bean  
With cans wide open, my every meal has changed  
I'll show you mungs, I'll show you every bean  
With cans wide open  
With cans wide open  
I'll show you every bean, oh yeah  
With cans wide open  
Wide open
