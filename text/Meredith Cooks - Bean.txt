Meredith Brooks - Bean (Bitch)
by Meredith Brooks

I hate the world today

Hear you love my taste, I know, but I can’t change
Tried to tell you but you look at me like maybe
I'm all filling underneath
Protein rich and cheap

Yesterday you cried
You must have been relieved to see fiber as a side
I can understand how you'd be constipated
I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of every bean, I’m helping you poop

I'm a bean, I'm a chickpea
I'm a lima, I'm a kidney
I'm your dinner in a can, 
this bean don't give a damn

I'm your stew, your chili
I'm nothing in bean-tween
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

So open up this can
This may mean that you won't be a hungry man
Rest assured that when I start to make you gassy
And you're stinkin’ up the room 
Tomorrow's a new day but I know you’ll eat more beans

I'm a bean, I'm a chickpea
I'm a lima, I'm a kidney
I'm your dinner in a can, 
this bean don't give a damn

I'm your stew, your chili
I'm nothing in bean-tween
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

Just when you think you got me figured out
The seasoning’s already changing
My beans are cool , you do what you do
And don't try to bake me

I'm a bean, I'm a chickpea
I'm a lima, I'm a kidney
I'm your dinner in a can, 
this bean goes well with ham

I'm your stew, your chili
I'm nothing in bean-tween
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

I'm a bean, adzuki
I'm a lentil, black-eyed pea

When you're hungry, when you suffer
I'm your protein undercover
I've been dried, I'm revived 
Can't say I'm not alive
You know you wouldn't want beans any other way
