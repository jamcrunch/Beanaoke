Please come now, I think I'm starving
I'm licking every morsel off my plate
It seems I found the road to hunger
And I'm trying to escape
My belly pangs for eats and grumbles (grumbles)
But I'm down to one last bean
And with it, let me say, let me say

Feed me now
It's 6 PM and I have not eaten
All I got is this bean I found

I'm looking down my bowl is empty
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
Thought I'd try intermittent fasting
Maybe lose some weight
I cried out, "Heaven, save me" (save me)
But I'm down to one last bean
And with it, let me say, let me say

Feed me now
It's six PM and I have not eaten
All I got is this bean I found
Feed me now
It's 6 PM and I haven't eaten
All I have is this bean I found
Will I survive

Famine follows me
But I still believe there's one bean left for me
So please come nourish me
'Cause I still believe there's one bean left for me to eat
For me to eat, for me to eat

Feed me now
It's 6 PM and I have not eaten

Feed me now
It's 6 PM and I have not eaten
All I got is this bean I found
Feed me now
It's 6 PM and I haven't eaten
All I have is this bean I found

Please come now, I think I'm starving
I'm licking every morsel off my plate

One time Scott Stapp skipped lunch and thought he was going to die from hunger. But he found a bean on the kitchen counter and it was able to keep him sated until his pizza delivery arrived. That was the inspiration for this song.
