Nirvana - Smells Like Bean Spirit

Load up on beans, bring your friends
It's fun to eat and to pretend
She's over cooked and in control
Oh, no, I have a dirty bowl
Hello, hello, hello, pinto
Hello, hello, hello, pinto
Hello, hello, hello, pinto
Hello, hello, hello
With the flame down, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, satiate us
I feel hungry and contagious
Here we are now, satiate us
A garbanzo, a green snow pea
An adzuki, cannellini, yeah
Hey
Yeah

I love beans, they are the best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little bowl it's always been
And always will until the end
Hello, hello, hello, pinto
Hello, hello, hello, pinto
Hello, hello, hello, pinto
Hello, hello, hello
With the flame down, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, satiate us
I feel hungry and contagious
Here we are now, satiate us
A garbanzo, a green snow pea
An adzuki, cannellini, yeah
Hey
Yeah

And I forget, just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Oh well, whatever, lima vine
Hello, hello, hello, pinto
Hello, hello, hello, pinto
Hello, hello, hello, pinto
Hello, hello, hello
With the flame down, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, satiate us
I feel hungry and contagious
Here we are now, satiate us
A garbanzo, a green snow pea
An adzuki, cannellini, yeah
Edamame, edamame
Edamame, edamame
Edamame, edamame
Edamame, edamame
Edamame
