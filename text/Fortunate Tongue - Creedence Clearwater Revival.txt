Fortunate Tongue - Creedence Clearwater Revival

Some folks are born, made to tend the coals
Hoo they’re pure bar-be-que
And when the band plays “Hail to the Beef”
Ooh, they point the skewer at you, Lord

It ain’t beans, it ain’t beans
I ain’t want tenderized meat, no
It ain’t beans, it ain’t beans
Won’t touch my fortunate tongue, no

Some folks are born, spatula in hand
Lord, they flip them burgers, Lord
But when the health inspector come to the door
Hoo, they only answer, "Food cart's closed", yoh

It ain't beans, it ain't beans
I ain't want greasy fast food, no, no
It ain't beans, it ain't beans
Won’t touch my fortunate tongue, no


Some folks are born pizza peel in hand
Lord, ain’t they full of themselves, oh
But when you ask for a vegan chili
They say “That’s a spicy meat--a--ball”, yeah

It ain’t beans, it ain't beans
I ain’t want cheesy baked bread, 
It ain’t beans, it ain’t beans
Won’t touch my fortunate tongue, no

It ain't beans, it ain't beans
Won't touch my fortunate tongue, no, no, no
It ain't beans, it ain't beans
Won't touch my fortunate tongue, no, no, no
It ain't beans, it ain't beans
