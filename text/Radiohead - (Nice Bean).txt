Radiohead - (Nice Bean)

***They love me like I was a brother
***They protect me, listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine, made me happy

Nice bean

Nice bean

I call up my friend, the good farmer
***But she's out with her answerphone
She says that she'd love to come help but
She has to stock, her farmer's market stall

***(If you think you belong enough) Nice bean
***(If you think that you're strong enough) Nice bean
***If you think you belong enough

***I'm coming home
***I'm coming home
***I'm coming home
***I'm coming home
