Garth Brooks - Beans in Low Places

I was just walking by, a sign caught my eye
And it said "Come swim in our beans"
Took a look inside, and I was surprised
Rewarded by my curiosity

Oh I frolicked and played my worries away
And I stood up when the clock neared three
Then I heard a clack, said "Honey, now what was that"
When I realized my reality

That I've got beans in low places
Trapped in my leg cuffs and my shoelaces, a bean buffet
Stuck to my body
Well I'll be finding bean pool traces
In my pant pockets it seems for ages
Oh, I've got beans in low places

Well I came home from SOAK, found some beans in my coat
Not sure how they got in there
I head to the bath, and let out a gasp
There’s pintos in my underwear

Loose beans in my couch, and all ‘round the house
Yet I have but not one regret
‘Cuz a dip in the beans, is my favorite thing
A night that I will never forget

Oh I've got beans in low places
Dropped on porto floors and other spaces, a bean buffet
Stuck to my body
Well I'll be finding bean pool traces
'Tween my seat cushions it seems for ages
Oh, I've got beans in low places

'Cause I've got beans in low places
Pressed against my skin, but I embrace it, a bean buffet
Stuck to my body
Well I'll be finding bean pool traces
On my car's floor mats it seems for ages
Oh, I've got beans in low places

Yeah I've got beans in low places
In the oddest spots, I can't evade 'em, a bean buffet
Stuck to my body
Well I'll be finding bean pool traces
In my camping tent it seems for ages
Oh, I've got beans in low places

Hey, I've got beans in low places
