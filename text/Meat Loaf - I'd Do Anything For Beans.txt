Meat Loaf - I'd Do Anything For Beans

And I would do anything for beans
I'd till the soil, break my back
I would do anything for beans
***

But I'll never forget the way you taste right now
Oh no, No way
And I would do anything for beans
Oh I would do anything for beans
I would do anything for beans
And I will do that
Yes I will do that

***Some days it don't come easy
***Some days it don't come hard
***Some days it don't come at all
***And these are the days that never end

***Some nights you're breathing fire
***Some nights you're carved in ice
***Some nights you're like nothing I've ever
***Seen before or will again

***Maybe I'm crazy, but it's crazy and it's true
***I know you can save me, no-one else can save me now but you
***As long as the wheels are turning
***As long as the bays are burning
***As long as your dreams are coming true
***You'd better believe it

***I would do anything for love
***I know it's true and that's a fact
***I would do anything for love
***And there'll never be no turning back
***But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
***So long, so long
***And I would do anything for love
***Oh, I would do anything for love
***I would do anything for love but I won't do that
***I won't do that
***I would do anything for love
***Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
***I would do anything for love
***Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
***I would do anything for love
***Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
***I would do anything for love
***Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
***I would do anything for love
***Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
***I would do anything for love
***Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do
***But I'll never stop dreaming of you
***every night of my life, no way
***But I would do anything for love
***But I won't do that
***Oh, I won't do that

Will you raise me up? Put a trellis down?
Will you help me grow out of this godforsaken ground?
***Can you make it all a little less cold?
I can do that
I can do that

***Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
***Can you colourise my life, I'm so sick of black and white?
***Can you make it all a little less old?
***I can do that
***Oh I can do that
***Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
***Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
***Can you give me something I can take home?
***I can do that
***I can do that
***Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
***Will you hose me down with holy water, if I get too hot?
***Will you take me places I've never known?
***I can do that
***Oh, I can do that
***After a while you'll forget everything
***It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
***And you'll see that it's time to move on
***No, I won't do that
***I won't do that
***I know the territory, I've been around
***It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
***Sooner or later you'll be screwing around
***I won't do that
***No, I won't do
***Anything for love
***Oh, I would do anything for love
***I would do anything for love
***but I won't do that
***No, I won't do that
