Chappell Roan - Pink Pinto Club

I know you wanted me to stay
But I can't ignore the crazy visions of me in LA
And I heard that there's a special place
Where boys and girls can all be beans every single day

I'm having legume dreams of bean pool ecstasy
Hear Santa Beanica, I swear it's calling me
Won't make my mama proud, it's gonna cause a scene
She sees her baby bean, I know she's gonna scream

God, what have you done?
You're a pink pinto girl
And you dance at the club
Oh mama, I'm just having fun
On the stage in my heels
It's where I belong down at the
Pink Pinto Club
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pinto Club
I'm gonna keep on dancing down in
West Beanywood
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pinto Club, Pink Pinto Club

I'm up and jaws are on the floor
Lovers in the bean pool and a line outside the door
Blacklights and a mirrored disco bean
Every night's another reason why I live the dream

I thank my legume dreams a year from Tennessee
Oh, Santa Beanica, you've been too good to me
Won't make my mama proud, it's gonna cause a scene
She sees her baby bean, I know she's gonna scream

God, what have you done?
You're a pink pinto girl
And you dance at the club
Oh mama, I'm just having fun
On the stage in my heels
It's where I belong down at the
Pink Pinto Club
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pinto Club
I'm gonna keep on dancing down in
West Beanywood 
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pinto Club, Pink Pinto Club

Don't think I've left you all behind
Still love you and Tennessee
You're always on my mind
And mama, every Saturday
I can hear your southern drawl a thousand miles away, saying

God, what have you done?
You're a pink pinto girl
And you dance at the club
Oh mama, I'm just having fun
On the stage in my heels
It's where I belong down at the
Pink Pinto Club
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pinto Club
I'm gonna keep on dancing down in
West Beanywood
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pinto Club, Pink Pinto Club
