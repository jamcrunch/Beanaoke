Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no

I look and stare so deep in your bowl
I dine with you every time more and more
When you leave, I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm cravin' and my gut is the one to blame
Yeah, 'cause I know I don't understand
Just how your beans can do what no one else can

Got me feeling so hungry right now, your beans
Got me feeling so hungry right now
Got me looking so crazy right now, your mungs
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll feed me right now, your beans
Got me hoping you'll feed me right now
Looking so crazy, your beans
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no

When I watch your crock simmer, patiently
Look at all them beans, I know they'll turn out tasty
You around, don't even need to fill my pantry
If you ain't here, I'd rather not even eat
It's the way that you know what I want to chew
It's the drool that my mouth drips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your beans can do what no one else can

Got me feeling so hungry right now, your beans
Got me feeling so hungry right now
Got me looking so crazy right now, your mungs
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll feed me right now, your beans
Got me hoping you'll feed me right now
Looking so crazy, your beans
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love
I'm looking so crazy in love
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no

Got me looking so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself, lately I'm peckish, a bean fetish
I've been gorging myself, baby, I don't care
'Cause your beans got the best of me
And, baby, you're making a pig of me
Wagging my tongue and I don't care who sees
'Cause, baby, you got me
You got me, you got me so crazy, baby

Got me feeling so hungry right now, your beans
Got me feeling so hungry right now
Got me looking so crazy right now, your mungs
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll feed me right now, your beans
Got me hoping you'll feed me right now
Looking so crazy, your beans
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

Got me feeling so hungry right now, your beans
Got me feeling so hungry right now
Got me looking so crazy right now, your mungs
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll feed me right now, your beans
Got me hoping you'll feed me right now
Looking so crazy, your beans
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love
