Bruce Springbean - Hungry Heart

Twis-ted knife and lids in a kit-chen shack
I went out for a can and I ne-ver came back,
Like some gar-den that's just ov-er-growin'
I reaped the fruits that I can't stop sewin'

Eve-ry-bo-dy's got a hun-gry heart,
Eve-ry bean's gon-na make you fart,
Lay down your mon-ey and you fill your cart,
Eve-ry-bean-ie’s gonna oh oh fill your heart
Oh oh oh

We grew some beans un-der-neath the stars,
We fell in love, I knew it'd ne-ver end
For brand new far-mers it's a ma-gic start,
Why don't you join us as we do it ag-ain

Eve-ry-bo-dy's got a hun-gry heart,
Eve-ry bean's gon-na make you fart,
Lay down your mon-ey and you fill your cart,
Eve-ry-bean-ie’s gonna oh oh fill your heart

No no no no no no, oh
No no no no no no

Eve-ry-bo-dy knows beans are the best
Some might say beans are the bomb
Don't make no dif-fer-ence what no-bo-dy says,=
We won't let you eat 'em al-one, no way

Eve-ry-bo-dy's got a hun-gry heart,
Eve-ry bean's gon-na make you fart,
Lay down your mon-ey and you fill your cart,
Eve-ry-bean-ie’s gonna oh oh fill your heart

Eve-ry-bo-dy's got a hun-gry heart,
Eve-ry bean's gon-na make you fart,
Lay down your mon-ey and you fill your cart,
Eve-ry-bean-ie’s gonna fill your heart
