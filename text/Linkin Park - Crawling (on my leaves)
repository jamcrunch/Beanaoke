Binkin Park - Crawling (on my leaves)

Crawling on my leaves
These holes, they will not heal
Sucking all my sap
My body is their meal

There's aphids eating me that feed beneath the surface
Consuming, ingesting
This lack of nutrients I feel is never ending
Depleting
I can't seem
To stand upright again
My leaves are yellowiiiiiiiing

I've felt this way before
These herbivores

Crawling on my leaves
These holes, they will not heal
Sucking all my sap
My body is their meal

Discolorationing has pulled itself upon me
Decaying, dismaying
Against my will I succumb to their starved predations
It's haunting
How I can't seem
To stand upright again
My leaves are yellowiiiiiiiing

I've felt this way before
These herbivores

Crawling on my leaves
These holes, they will not heal
Sucking all my sap
My body is their meal

Crawling on my leaves
These holes, they will not heal
Sucking all my sap
My body, my body is their meal

My body is their meal
My body is their meal
