*Another bean hangs lowly*  
*Bean is slowly taken*  
*And the violence caused such silence*  
*Who are we mistaken?*

But you see, it's not beans
It's not my bag of peas
In your can, in your can, they are cooking
With their peas, and their mungs
And their mungs, and favas
In your can, in your can, they are frying

In your can, in your can
Zombean, zombean, zombean-ean-ean
What's in your can, in your can?
Zombean, Zombean, Zombean-ean-ean-ean oh

Do, do, do, do  
Do, do, do, do  
Do, do, do, do  
Do, do, do, do

It's the same old theme
Since nineteen-sixbean
In your can, in your can, they're still frying
With their peas, and their mungs
And their mungs, and favas
In your can, in your can, they are frying

In your can, in your can
Zombean...
