Sweet dreams are made of beans
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's cooking for something

Some of them want to soak you
Some of them want to refry you
Some of them want to bake you
Some of them want to make you food

Sweet dreams are made of beans
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's cooking for something

Hold your lid up, stewin' on
Keep your lid up, stewin' on
