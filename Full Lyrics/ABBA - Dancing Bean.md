Ooh
You can dance
You can fry
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that bean
Watch that scene
Digging the dancing bean

Friday night and the stove's on low
Looking out for a grill to go
Where they add the right spices
Getting in the pot
You come to look for a crock

Anybody could be that chef
Night is young and the kitchen's a mess
With a bit of kosher salt
Everything is fine
You're in the mood for a snack
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing bean
Fri-jo-lee
Topped with sour cream
Dancing bean
Staple of many world cuisines, oh yeah
You can dance
You can fry
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that bean
Watch that scene
Digging the dancing bean

You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em hung'rin' and then you're gone
Looking out for another
Anyone will do
You're in the mood for a snack
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing bean
Fri-jo-lee
Topped with sour cream
Dancing bean
Staple of many world cuisines, oh yeah
You can dance
You can fry
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that bean
Watch that scene
Digging the dancing bean
