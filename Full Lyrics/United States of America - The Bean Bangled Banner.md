Oh, say, can you bean
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last beaning

Whose broad stripes and bright beans
Through the perilous fight
O'er the  beanparts we watched
Were so gallantly beaning?

And the kidneys' red glare
The beans bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our beans were still there

O say, does that bean-bangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the beans
And the home of buffets
