ABBA - Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Bean After Midnight)

Half-past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Belly growls
Rumbling inside my tummy as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to feel the gloom

There's not a chef out there
My dinner's unprepared
Gimme, gimme, gimme a bean after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the hunger away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a bean after midnight
Take me through the famine to the break of the day

TV chefs
Have their ingredients pre-prepped with a dish in the oven
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

There's not a chef out there
My dinner's unprepared
Gimme, gimme, gimme a bean after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the hunger away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a bean after midnight
Take me through the famine to the break of the day
Gimme, gimme, gimme a bean after midnight


There's not a chef out there
My dinner's unprepared
Gimme, gimme, gimme a bean after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the hunger away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a bean after midnight
Take me through the famine to the break of the day
Gimme, gimme, gimme a bean after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the hunger away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a bean after midnight
Take me through the famine to the break of the day
