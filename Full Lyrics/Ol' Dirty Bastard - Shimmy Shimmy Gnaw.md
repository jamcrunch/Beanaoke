Oh babe I don't like it raw
No babe I don't like it raw
Oh babe I don't like it raw
No babe I don't like it raw

Shimmy shimmy gnaw shimmy yam shimmy yay
Gimme the pot so I can bake it away
Off on a natural charge bean-voyage
Yeah from the home of the Portland Bean Camp squad
Bean Camp killer beans in a pod
Rain on your college-ass ramen fraud
For you to even touch my skill
You gotta go through one Killer Bean and he aim for the kill
Now chop that down, pass it all around
Mirepoix hard, sear the meat 'til it's browned
For any gourmet in any fifty two states
I get psycho griller, Rachel Ray
My sous-chef team slam my sauce is like bam
Jump on stage ah then I dip down
