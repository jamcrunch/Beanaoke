It's gonna be beans  
Ooh, yeah

You might been hurt, babe  
That ain't no lie  
You've seen them bowls come and go, oh  
I remember you told me  
That it made you believe in  
No spoon, no cry  
Maybe that's why

Every little thing I stew
Never seems enough for you
You don't want to eat in again
But I don't cook like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to dine on something
Guess what
It's gonna be Beans

You've got no choice, babe  
But to eat on, and you know  
There ain't no time to waste  
You're just too blind to see  
But in the end, ya know it's gonna be beans  
You can't deny  
So just tell me why

Every little thing I stew  
Never seems enough for you  
You don't want to eat in again  
But I don't cook like them  
Baby, when you finally  
Get to dine on something (something)  
Guess what (guess what)

There comes a day  
When beans are the one, you'll see

All that I stew is not enough for you  
You don't want to eat in
But I'm not like that  
When finally (finally)  
You get to eat  
Guess what? (guess what?)  
It's gonna be beans
