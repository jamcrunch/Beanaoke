[Verse 1]
I want your limas, I want your kidneys
I want your everybean as long as it's free
I want your beans
Beans, beans, beans, I want your beans, ayy
I want your chickpeas, freshly picked or canned (Hey)
I want your cannellini kiss in the sand
I want your beans
Beans, beans, beans, I want your beans
(Beans, beans, beans, I want your beans)

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I want beans
And you know that I need beans
I want it bad, your bean romance

[Chorus]
I want your beans and I want to pretend
You and me could write a bean romance (Oh)
***I want your beans and all your farmer's bean hedge
You and me could write a bean romance
Oh, caught in a bean romance
Oh, caught in a bean romance

I want your limas, picked straight from the vine
'Cause you're a cassoulet as long as you're mine
I want your beans
Beans, beans, beans, I want your beans
***I want your navies, your simmering schtick (Hey)
Want you in my bean salad, baby, you're sick
I want your beans
Beans, beans, beans, I want your beans
(Beans, beans, beans, I want your beans)


You know that I want beans
And you know that I need beans
I want it bad, your bean romance
I want your beans and I want to pretend
You and me could write a bean romance (Oh)
***I want your beans and all your lover's revenge
You and me could write a bean romance
Oh, caught in a bean romance
Oh, caught in a bean romance

Stalk, stalk, bean stalk, baby
Work it, I'm a free bean, baby
