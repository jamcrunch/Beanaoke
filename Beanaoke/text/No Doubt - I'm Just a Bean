No Doubt - I'm Just a Bean

Strip this pod 'round my body bye
I'm exposed and it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand?
This world is serving me with rice and ham

'Cause I'm just a bean, a, little old me
Well, please let me soak overnight
Oh, I'm just a bean, full of starch and protein
So why not just take a little bite?

***Oh, I've had it up to here

***The moment that I step outside
***So many reasons for me to run and hide
***I can't do the little things I hold so dear
***'Cause it's all those little things that I fear

***'Cause I'm just a bean, I'd rather not be
***'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
***Oh, I'm just a bean, guess I'm some kind of freak
***'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes

***Oh, I'm just a bean, take a good look at me
***Just your typical prototype
***Oh, I've had it up to here
***Oh, am I making myself clear?
***I'm just a bean
***I'm just a bean in the world
***That's all that you'll let me be
***Oh, I'm just a bean, living in captivity
***Your rule of thumb makes me worrisome
***Oh, I'm just a bean, what's my destiny?
***What I've succumbed to is making me numb
***Oh, I'm just a bean, my apologies
***What I've become is so burdensome
***Oh, I'm just a bean, lucky me
***Twiddle-dum, there's no comparison
***Oh, I've had it up to
***Oh, I've had it up to
***Oh, I've had it up to here
